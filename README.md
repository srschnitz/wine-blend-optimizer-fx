Chemist → Data Analyst → Back to the bench(sorta).   Blended grocery wine into a 4-factor DOE (Cab, Merlot, Zin, Sulfur, Region).   12 blind-tasted blends, pH, SO₂, ΔE, ANOVA + time effects.   From kitchen lab to Christmas gifts.   Simple. Expandable. Real.   *Because the best DOE yields the info you need... and tastes good.*
