## From Drift to Pour: A Chemist’s Return with data skills in hand. 

Last year, I couldn’t answer simple chemistry question(s) asked of me.  Yikes.  (In mine defense, my mine was on not the best news I had just received, but...., no excuses.)  

This year, I’m **measuring it**, **modeling it**, and **drinking it**.
> The next questoin that I could answer was "“What’s your favorite DOE?" -**The one that gives me the answer or direction I am looking for.**  

1. Project Purpose / Motivation
This project explores how design of experiments (DOE) can optimize wine blends for taste, chemistry, and storytelling. It’s a personal return to chemistry through data—equal parts redemption and fermentation.
- A **4-factor fractional DOE** (Cab, Merlot, Zin, Sulfur, Region)  
- **12 randomized, blind-tasted blends**  
- **pH, ΔE, free SO₂, taste (1–10 rubric)**  
- **ANOVA + time covariate**
- *Bayesian Linear Regression -Wine Preference modeling*
- **Comparing data analysis applications via coding methods and software programs like minitab.
- **Christmas gifts** (sorry, not sorry)
2. Tools & Stack
- **Design of Experiments (DOE)**: Fractional factorial design, randomized block
- **Statistical Analysis**: ANOVA, Bayesian regression (planned)
- **Software**: Minitab (legacy), Jamovi (GUI), R (FrF2', 'rsm', 'brms') Python ('pandas', 'statmodels', 'scipy.stats', 'bambi')
- **Visualization**: Power BI, ggplot2, matplotlib
- **Data Management**: Snowflake (???working on it), Excel


  Python (pandas, statsmodels, scipy.stats, bambi), R(rsm,brms, DoE.base), Excel, Power BI, randomized block design, ANOVA
  Minitab, Jamovi
**Next**: Response surface, coffee brew DOE, maybe a **plant growth sequel**.
*Because the best way back to your roots?*  
**Pour one.**
